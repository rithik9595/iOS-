/// https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/slider
/// A user interface control that allows for the adjustment of a value within a bounded range.
///
/// In SwiftUI, the Slider presents a track with a draggable thumb, enabling users to
/// select a value within a predefined range. It often finds application in settings,
/// controls, and configurations where a specific value, such as volume or brightness,
/// needs adjustment. The Slider interacts directly with a binding to a source of truth,
/// ensuring the selected value gets captured and reflected in real-time.
///
/// In this example, we have a Slider that allows users to adjust the volume level.
/// The current volume level, represented as a percentage, is displayed above the slider
/// and is stored in the volume property.

struct ContentView: View {
    /// A bindable property that holds the current value of the slider
    @State private var volume: Float = 50

    var body: some View {
        /// A VStack containing a label and the Slider.
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            /// Display the current volume as a percentage
           
            //Text("Volume: \(Float(volume))")
