/// A user interface control which allows the user to trigger an open
/// URL action. This control can be used to navigate outside of the app.

/// To create a Link, you provide a title (or label) and a URL as the destination.
/// Here's an example of creating a link to navigate to "apple.com":

struct ContentView: View {

        /*
        /// A link that, when tapped, navigates the user to "apple.com"
        Link("Go to Apple Domain site",
             destination: URL(string: "https://apple.com/")!)
         */

        Link(destination: URL(string: "https://codewithchris.com/")!) {
            /// The button is visually represented by an HStack containing an image (depicting a globe)
            /// and a text saying "Visit us!". Both elements have a large title font, and the whole
            HStack(spacing: 20.0) {
